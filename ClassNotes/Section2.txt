Control 
	- text 
		{
			- it lets the user see what to choose on 
			- every control has it  
		}
	- Name
		{
			- is your key
			- is also the 
		}
			
Child Form 
	- every Form has a parent 
	- every child should have a parent form 
	- parent---> child 
		- modals 
			- the person can not get back to the parent windows 
			- it blocks the user 
			- forcing the user to make a user 
			- make a decision or cancel 
		- modeless 
			- two windows open the user can interact with both 
			- tool widows are these 

form 
	{
		-	show dalog ()
			- model 
		- 	Show( )
			- modeless 
	}
close 
	{
		- call close the form does this
	}
Name
	{
		- is unter control 
		
show dialog() ---> Dialog Result
						
						0k
						cancel
						yes
						no
get value of text box 
	- Text
	-  Name control 
		{
			- it controls the field property 
			- has a unique name, design time to; 
		}
2. Show a child form in modey
	{
		- show dialog mode 
		- // in modeless form us Show
		- cancel dialog 
		- name.cancel 
	}
3. 
	{
	 chld form the Return value of showDialog 
	)

Class 
 {
	Validate an object
	name has to be unique 
	has to be your responible 
 }
Base Class 
	{
		gett he basics stuff 
		and expand it in our form 
	}
Constructor 
{
- has the same name as type 
- no return type 
- var char = new_T()
	-1. Allociates memory 
		new 
		- allocates enough memory for that type of memory
		-  or the number of fields 
	-2.initaties fields 
		- calls of the object 
	-3. call the consturctor 
		- reference back to the var char. 
- public Product ()
	{
		// Cross field initialization 
		- only use .base();  if you are calling it in somewhere else 
	}
- protected 
	{
		- drive types see it as public 
		- every once else see it has private
		- combinning of public and private 
	}
- virtual 
	- you can also use abstract
	
-Constructor chaining 
	{
		- chain a consturctor call to another constructor
	}
example 
	-  this calls the current object
	- base to use the base 
	- con hello(Command)_Command
		public Hello COmmand () : base("Hello")
		{
		}
	- public virtual void DoWork() 
	{
			
			public override DoWork()
			{
			base.DoWork(); 
			}
	}
- vitual 
	A) number is virtual 
	B) disable on implemation 
	C) calll back if numfil

Win Forms 
- Delete = void (object, EvertArgs)
- Edit = void object, ExertArgs)
- Add = void (object, ExertArgs)
- Same function type and very excansable 
- or delegate in C# 
- returns a return type or function 
- can do it with variable 
- delegete 
	-  allow us  to open up code and call it 
	- dynamic enviroment 
public delegate void ButtonClickCall( object sender, EventArgs event Args); 

private void CallButton( ButtonClickCall functionToCall) 
{
	funcitonToCall(this, EventArgs.Empty); 
}
	-  delegate only work with functions 

.link
	-  to show how many arrays can happen 
	
listofStudeentname 
{
	string[] name = new string[100]
							string (20) = will display null 
	ennumate 
	
	foreach (var name - names)
	{
	
	}
need to data bound 
- mostly automated 

system.Collection 
	- list 
	- collection 
	- stack 
	- cube
	- Dictionary key = vlaue
Don't use ArrayList
System.Colleciton.ArrayList don't really use it 
	-Default
		- List		  //implemation(private)  
		- Collection  // public 
	- Need rhs
		-Stack 
		-Queue 
	- My Key to value

Prdouct[]
iont[]
string[]
get (int)=> _items[index]
add (product)
{
	FindLastElement()
		- if no room relocate()
	InsertNew()

	"delete.it"
}

Generic Type 
private List<Product> _list = new List<Product>(); 
for creating a new product in a list of current products

1) interface 
	- construct or extract 
	- get past the compiler, and talk to a different peace of code 
	- eassier to change 
2) certain members 
	- properties 
	- methods 
	- events 
3) validation interface 
	- Ivelidated object 
nameof operator 
	- identifier 
	- takes any identifer, and changes to any  string identifier 
	- compiler is going do that anyways 
	- enemilates a string identifier floating around 
	
yield operation 
	- illiator 
	- IEnumberable T
		- collation of items of a list 
	- only can be used in iEnumberable_T_ 
	- defer exicution 
	- yield actural resistes what you can do 

Directory 
	- getfiles (path, file) -> string[] 
	- windows 
		- assembly
		- temp
		- system32
		- system 64
		- divery
	- return back a string array 
	- to build it 
		- look at every file, and everything inside it 
	- use a list, and expand that 
	-	- really slow 
		- slow
	- uses enumator IEnumeramator< string // takes time of looking at each file 
		- var file =  Directory IEnumerable
			- if(string.IsNullorEmpty(Name))
				yield return new ValidationResult("Name cannot be empy.", new[] (namof(Name) });
			- if(Price < 0)
				- yield return new ValidationResult("Price must be >=0.", new[](naeof(PRice)}); 
	- list/ collection
			-  lists are fields 
			- are readable and writeable
			-  are second for adding new list 
			- array's and replaceable 
			- is third and not really used for adding stuff unless its not really long and has the same return type 
	IEnumberable is - repeaterable 
		- the number one chose is number 1 
		- cannot add files 
	
More interfaces
	- iVadilable object 
		-  whats members can you call 
			- obj validate (); 
		- Product p.validate 
			- 
		-  it dynamic validate code for you
